# Connectors [action-types]

Connectors provide a central place to store connection information for services and integrations with Elastic or third party systems. Actions are instantiations of a connector that are linked to rules and run as background tasks on the {{kib}} server when rule conditions are met. {{kib}} provides the following types of connectors:

## Managing connectors [connector-management]

Rules use connectors to route actions to different destinations like log files, ticketing systems, and messaging tools. While each {{kib}} app can offer their own types of rules, they typically share connectors. **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}** offers a central place to view and manage all the connectors in the current space.

:alt: Example connector listing in the {{rules-ui}} UI
:class: screenshot
:::


## Required permissions [_required_permissions_2]

Access to connectors is granted based on your privileges to alerting-enabled features. For more information, go to [Security](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts/alerting-setup.md#alerting-security).


## Connector networking configuration [_connector_networking_configuration]

Use the [action configuration settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/alert-action-settings-kb.html#action-settings) to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.


## Connector list [connectors-list]

In **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}**, you can find a list of the connectors in the current space. You can use the search bar to find specific connectors by name and type. The **Type** dropdown also enables you to filter to a subset of connector types.

You can delete individual connectors using the trash icon. Alternatively, select multiple connectors and delete them in bulk using the **Delete** button.

:::

::::{note}
You can delete a connector even if there are still actions referencing it. When this happens the action will fail to run and errors appear in the {{kib}} logs.

## Creating a new connector [creating-new-connector]

New connectors can be created with the **Create connector** button, which guides you to select the type of connector and configure its properties.

:::{image} ../../../images/kibana-connector-select-type.png
:alt: Connector select type
:class: screenshot
:::

After you create a connector, it is available for use any time you set up an action in the current space.

For out-of-the-box and standardized connectors, refer to [preconfigured connectors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/pre-configured-connectors.html).

::::{tip}
You can also manage connectors as resources with the [Elasticstack provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest) for Terraform. For more details, refer to the [elasticstack_kibana_action_connector](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/kibana_action_connector) resource.

## Importing and exporting connectors [importing-and-exporting-connectors]

To import and export connectors, use the [Saved Objects Management UI](../../../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/saved-objects.md).

:::{image} ../../../images/kibana-connectors-import-banner.png
:alt: Connectors import banner
:class: screenshot

If a connector is missing sensitive information after the import, a **Fix** button appears in **{{connectors-ui}}**.

## Monitoring connectors [monitoring-connectors]

The [Task Manager health API](../../../deploy-manage/monitor/kibana-task-manager-health-monitoring.md) helps you understand the performance of all tasks in your environment. However, if connectors fail to run, they will report as successful to Task Manager. The failure stats will not accurately depict the performance of connectors.

For more information on connector successes and failures, refer to the [Event log index](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts/event-log-index.md).
