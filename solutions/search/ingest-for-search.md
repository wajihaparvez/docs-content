# Ingest for search use cases

::::{note}
This page covers ingest methods specifically for search use cases. If you're working with a different use case, refer to the [ingestion overview](/manage-data/ingest.md) for more options.
::::

Search use cases usually focus on general **content**, typically text-heavy data that does not have a timestamp. This could be data like knowledge bases, website content, product catalogs, and more.

Once you've decided how to [deploy Elastic](/deploy-manage/index.md), the next step is getting your content into {{es}}. Your choice of ingestion method depends on where your content lives and how you need to access it.

There are several methods to ingest data into {{es}} for search use cases. Choose one or more based on your requirements.

::::{tip}
If you just want to do a quick test, you can load [sample data](/manage-data/ingest/sample-data.md) into your {{es}} cluster using the UI.
::::

## Use APIs [es-ingestion-overview-apis] 

You can use the [`_bulk` API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/v8/group/endpoint-document) to add data to your {{es}} indices, using any HTTP client, including the [{{es}} client libraries](/solutions/search/site-or-app/clients.md).

While the {{es}} APIs can be used for any data type, Elastic provides specialized tools that optimize ingestion for specific use cases.

## Use specialized tools [es-ingestion-overview-general-content]

You can use these specialized tools to add general content to {{es}} indices.

| Method | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| [**Web crawler**](https://github.com/elastic/crawler) | Programmatically discover and index content from websites and knowledge bases | Crawl public-facing web content or internal sites accessible via HTTP proxy |
| [**Search connectors**]() | Third-party integrations to popular content sources like databases, cloud storage, and business applications | Choose from a range of Elastic-built connectors or build your own in Python using the Elastic connector framework|
| [**File upload**](/manage-data/ingest/tools/upload-data-files.md)| One-off manual uploads through the UI | Useful for testing or very small-scale use cases, but not recommended for production workflows |

### Process data at ingest time

You can also transform and enrich your content at ingest time using [ingest pipelines](/manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md).

The Elastic UI has a set of tools for creating and managing indices optimized for search use cases. You can also manage your ingest pipelines in this UI. Learn more in [](search-pipelines.md).
