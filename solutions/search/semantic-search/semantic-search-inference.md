# Semantic search with the inference API [semantic-search-inference]


The instructions in this tutorial shows you how to use the {{infer}} API workflow with various services to perform semantic search on your data.

::::{important}
For the easiest way to perform semantic search in the {{stack}}, refer to the [`semantic_text`](semantic-search-semantic-text.md) end-to-end tutorial.
::::


The following examples use the:

* `embed-english-v3.0` model for [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cohere-embed)
* `all-mpnet-base-v2` model from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
* `text-embedding-ada-002` second generation embedding model for OpenAI
* models available through [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models?selectedTask=embeddings) or [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models)
* `text-embedding-004` model for [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-embeddings-api)
* `mistral-embed` model for [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/)
* `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1` model for [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.md)
* `ops-text-embedding-zh-001` model for [AlibabaCloud AI](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/open-search/search-platform/developer-reference/text-embedding-api-details)

You can use any Cohere and OpenAI models, they are all supported by the {{infer}} API. For a list of recommended models available on HuggingFace, refer to [the supported model list](../inference-api/huggingface-inference-integration.md#inference-example-hugging-face-supported-models).

## Create an inference endpoint [infer-text-embedding-task]

Create an {{infer}} endpoint by using the [Create {{infer}} API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-inference-api.html):

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} Cohere
```console
PUT _inference/text_embedding/cohere_embeddings <1>
{
    "service": "cohere",
    "service_settings": {
        "api_key": "<api_key>", <2>
        "model_id": "embed-english-v3.0", <3>
        "embedding_type": "byte"
    }
}
```

1. The task type is `text_embedding` in the path and the `inference_id` which is the unique identifier of the {{infer}} endpoint is `cohere_embeddings`.
2. The API key of your Cohere account. You can find your API keys in your Cohere dashboard under the [API keys section](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys). You need to provide your API key only once. The [Get {{infer}} API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/get-inference-api.html) does not return your API key.
3. The name of the embedding model to use. You can find the list of Cohere embedding models [here](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed).


::::{note}
When using this model the recommended similarity measure to use in the `dense_vector` field mapping is `dot_product`. In the case of Cohere models, the embeddings are normalized to unit length in which case the `dot_product` and the `cosine` measures are equivalent.
::::
::::::

::::::{tab-item} ELSER
```console
PUT _inference/sparse_embedding/elser_embeddings <1>
{
  "service": "elasticsearch",
  "service_settings": {
    "num_allocations": 1,
    "num_threads": 1
  }
}
```

1. The task type is `sparse_embedding` in the path and the `inference_id` which is the unique identifier of the {{infer}} endpoint is `elser_embeddings`.


You don’t need to download and deploy the ELSER model upfront, the API request above will download the model if it’s not downloaded yet and then deploy it.

::::{note}
You might see a 502 bad gateway error in the response when using the {{kib}} Console. This error usually just reflects a timeout, while the model downloads in the background. You can check the download progress in the {{ml-app}} UI. If using the Python client, you can set the `timeout` parameter to a higher value.

::::
::::::

::::::{tab-item} HuggingFace
First, you need to create a new {{infer}} endpoint on [the Hugging Face endpoint page](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) to get an endpoint URL. Select the model `all-mpnet-base-v2` on the new endpoint creation page, then select the `Sentence Embeddings` task under the Advanced configuration section. Create the endpoint. Copy the URL after the endpoint initialization has been finished, you need the URL in the following {{infer}} API call.

```console
PUT _inference/text_embedding/hugging_face_embeddings <1>
{
  "service": "hugging_face",
  "service_settings": {
    "api_key": "<access_token>", <2>
    "url": "<url_endpoint>" <3>
  }
}
```

1. The task type is `text_embedding` in the path and the `inference_id` which is the unique identifier of the {{infer}} endpoint is `hugging_face_embeddings`.

    "service_settings": {
        "api_key": "<api_key>", <2>
        "model_id": "text-embedding-ada-002" <3>
    }
}
```

1. The task type is `text_embedding` in the path and the `inference_id` which is the unique identifier of the {{infer}} endpoint is `openai_embeddings`.
2. The API key of your OpenAI account. You can find your OpenAI API keys in your OpenAI account under the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You need to provide your API key only once. The [Get {{infer}} API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/get-inference-api.html) does not return your API key.
3. The name of the embedding model to use. You can find the list of OpenAI embedding models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models).


::::{note}
When using this model the recommended similarity measure to use in the `dense_vector` field mapping is `dot_product`. In the case of OpenAI models, the embeddings are normalized to unit length in which case the `dot_product` and the `cosine` measures are equivalent.

## Load data [infer-load-data]

In this step, you load the data that you later use in the {{infer}} ingest pipeline to create embeddings from it.

Use the `msmarco-passagetest2019-top1000` data set, which is a subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking data set. It consists of 200 queries, each accompanied by a list of relevant text passages. All unique passages, along with their IDs, have been extracted from that data set and compiled into a [tsv file](https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/blob/main/docs/en/stack/ml/nlp/data/msmarco-passagetest2019-unique.tsv).

Download the file and upload it to your cluster using the [Data Visualizer](../../../manage-data/ingest.md#upload-data-kibana) in the {{ml-app}} UI. After your data is analyzed, click **Override settings**. Under **Edit field names***, assign `id` to the first column and `content` to the second. Click ***Apply***, then ***Import**. Name the index `test-data`, and click **Import**. After the upload is complete, you will see an index named `test-data` with 182,469 documents.


## Ingest the data through the {{infer}} ingest pipeline [reindexing-data-infer]

Create embeddings from the text by reindexing the data through the {{infer}} pipeline that uses your chosen model. This step uses the [reindex API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html) to simulate data ingestion through a pipeline.

The call returns a task ID to monitor the progress:

```console
GET _tasks/<task_id>
```

Reindexing large datasets can take a long time. You can test this workflow using only a subset of the dataset. Do this by cancelling the reindexing process, and only generating embeddings for the subset that was reindexed. The following API request will cancel the reindexing task:

```console
POST _tasks/<task_id>/_cancel
```


## Semantic search [infer-semantic-search]

After the data set has been enriched with the embeddings, you can query the data using [semantic search](../vector/knn.md#knn-semantic-search). In case of dense vector models, pass a `query_vector_builder` to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) vector search API, and provide the query text and the model you have used to create the embeddings. In case of a sparse vector model like ELSER, use a `sparse_vector` query, and provide the query text with the model you have used to create the embeddings.

::::{note}
If you cancelled the reindexing process, you run the query only a part of the data which affects the quality of your results.
