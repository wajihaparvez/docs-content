# Elasticsearch Metrics [elasticsearch-metrics]


You can drill down into the status of your {{es}} cluster in {{kib}} by clicking the [Overview](#cluster-overview-page), [Nodes](#nodes-page), [Indices](#indices-overview-page) and [Logs](#logs-monitor-page) links on the **Stack Monitoring** page.

For more information, refer to [Monitor a cluster](../../monitor.md).


## Cluster Overview [cluster-overview-page]

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of an {{es}} cluster, click **Overview** in the {{es}} section. Anything that needs your attention is highlighted in yellow or red.

::::{tip}
Conditions that require your attention are listed at the top of the Clusters page. You can also set up watches to alert you when the status of your cluster changes. To learn how, see [Watching the status of an {{es}} cluster](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/watcher/watch-cluster-status.md).
::::


The panel at the top shows the current cluster statistics, the charts show the search and indexing performance over time, and the table at the bottom shows information about any shards that are being recovered. If you use {{filebeat}} to collect log data from this cluster, you can also see its recent logs.

From there, you can dive into detailed metrics for particular nodes and indices.


## Nodes [nodes-page]

To view node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section shows the status of each node in your cluster.


### Node Overview [nodes-page-overview]

Click the name of a node to view its node statistics over time. These represent high-level statistics collected from {{es}} that provide a good overview of health. If you use {{filebeat}} to collect log data from this node, you can also see its recent logs.


### Node Advanced [nodes-page-advanced]

To view advanced node metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for a node. The **Advanced** tab shows additional metrics, such as memory and garbage collection statistics reported by the selected {{es}} node.

You can use the advanced node view to diagnose issues that generally involve more advanced knowledge of {{es}}, such as poor garbage collection performance.


## Indices [indices-overview-page]

To view index metrics, click **Indices**. The Indices section shows the same overall index and search metrics as the Overview and a table of your indices.


### Index Overview [indices-page-overview]

From the Indices listing, you can view data for a particular index. To drill down into the data for a particular index, click its name in the Indices table.


### Index Advanced [indices-page-advanced]

To view advanced index metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for an index. The **Advanced**  tab shows additional metrics, such as memory statistics reported about the {{es}} index. If the index has more than one shard, then its shards might live on more than one node.

The Advanced index view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve more advanced knowledge of {{es}}, such as wasteful index memory usage.


## Jobs [jobs-page]

To view {{ml}} job metrics, click **Jobs**. For each job in your cluster, it shows information such as its status, the number of records processed, the size of the model, the number of forecasts, and the node that runs the job.


## CCR [ccr-overview-page]

To view {{ccr}} metrics, click **CCR**. For each follower index on the cluster, it shows the following information:

* **Index**: The name of the follower index.
* **Follows**: The name of the leader index.
* **Alerts**: Any read exceptions that have been triggered for the index or its shards.
* **Sync Lag (ops)**: How many operations the follower index is lagging behind the leader index.

    This is calculated by finding the difference between the minimum and maximum operation sequence number on the leader (`leader_max_seq_no`) and the difference between the minimum and maximum global sequence number checkpoint on the follower (`follower_global_checkpoint`) for each shard over the selected time period. The difference in `follower_global_checkpoint` is subtracted from the difference in `leader_max_seq_no` for each shard, and the highest result across all shards is displayed.

* **Last fetch time**: The time elapsed since the last successful fetch from the leader index. Represents the longest time elapsed across all of the shards in the follower index.
* **Ops synced**: The number of operations indexed (replicated) into the follower index from the leader index in the selected time period.

    This metric is a sum of the number of operations indexed across all shards over the selected time period.

* **Error**: Any exceptions returned for the most recent document in the selected time period.

If you select a follower index, you can view the same information for each shard. For more information on the properties used to calculate these metrics, refer to the [get follower stats API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ccr-get-follow-stats.html) documentation.

If you select a shard, you can see graphs for the fetch and operation delays. You can also see advanced information, which contains additional stats from the [get follower stats API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ccr-get-follow-stats.html).

Learn more about [{{ccr-cap}}](../../tools/cross-cluster-replication.md).


## Logs [logs-monitor-page]

If you use {{filebeat}} to collect log data from your cluster, you can see its recent logs in the **Stack Monitoring** application. The **Clusters** page lists the number of informational, debug, and warning messages in the server and deprecation logs.

If you click **Logs**, you can see the most recent logs for the cluster.

::::{tip}
By default, up to 10 log entries are shown. You can show up to 50 log entries by changing the [`monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.logFetchCount` setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/monitoring-settings-kb.html#monitoring-ui-settings). If you changed the default name of filebeat indices, you also need to update `monitoring.ui.logs.index` accordingly.
