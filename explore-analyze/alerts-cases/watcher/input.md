# Inputs [input]


When a watch is triggered, its *input* loads data into the execution context. This payload is accessible during the subsequent watch execution phases. For example, you can base a watch’s condition on the data loaded by its input.

{{watcher}} supports four input types:

* [`simple`](input-simple.md): load static data into the execution context.
* [`search`](input-search.md): load the results of a search into the execution context.
* [`http`](input-http.md): load the results of an HTTP request into the execution context.
* [`chain`](input-chain.md): use a series of inputs to load data into the execution context.

::::{note} 
If you don’t define an input for a watch, an empty payload is loaded into the execution context.
