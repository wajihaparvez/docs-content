# Search input [input-search]


Use the `search` input to load the results of an Elasticsearch search request into the execution context when the watch is triggered. See [Search Input Attributes](#search-input-attributes) for all of the supported attributes.

In the search input’s `request` object, you specify:

* The indices you want to search
* The [search type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html#search-type)
* The search request body

The search request body supports the full Elasticsearch Query DSL—​it’s the same as the body of an Elasticsearch `_search` request.

For example, the following input retrieves all `event` documents from the `logs` index:

```js
"input" : {
  "search" : {
    "request" : {
      "indices" : [ "logs" ],
      "body" : {
        "query" : { "match_all" : {}}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can use date math and wildcards when specifying indices. For example, the following input loads the latest VIXZ quote from today’s daily quotes index:

```js
{
  "input" : {
    "search" : {
      "request" : {
        "indices" : [ "<stock-quotes-{now/d}>" ],
        "body" : {
          "size" : 1,
          "sort" : {
            "timestamp" : { "order" : "desc"}
          },
          "query" : {
            "term" : { "symbol" : "vix"}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Extracting specific fields [_extracting_specific_fields]

You can specify which fields in the search response you want to load into the watch payload with the `extract` attribute. This is useful when a search generates a large response and you are only interested in particular fields.

For example, the following input loads only the total number of hits into the watch payload:

```js
"input": {
    "search": {
      "request": {
        "indices": [ ".watcher-history*" ]
      },
      "extract": [ "hits.total.value" ]
    }
  },
```


## Using Templates [_using_templates]

The `search` input supports [search templates](../../../solutions/search/search-templates.md). For example, the following snippet references the indexed template called `my_template` and passes a value of 23 to fill in the template’s `value` parameter:

```js
{
  "input" : {
    "search" : {
      "request" : {
        "indices" : [ "logs" ],
        "template" : {
          "id" : "my_template",
          "params" : {
            "value" : 23
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```


## Applying conditions [_applying_conditions]

The `search` input is often used in conjunction with the [`script`](condition-script.md) condition. For example, the following snippet adds a condition to check if the search returned more than five hits:

```js
{
  "input" : {
    "search" : {
      "request" : {
        "indices" : [ "logs" ],
        "body" : {
          "query" : { "match_all" : {} }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "condition" : {
    "compare" : { "ctx.payload.hits.total" : { "gt" : 5 }}
  }
  ...
}
```


## Accessing the search results [_accessing_the_search_results]

Conditions, transforms, and actions can access the search results through the watch execution context. For example:

* To load all of the search hits into an email body, use `ctx.payload.hits`.
* To reference the total number of hits, use `ctx.payload.hits.total`.
* To access a particular hit, use its zero-based array index. For example, to get the third hit, use `ctx.payload.hits.hits.2`.
* To get a field value from a particular hit, use `ctx.payload.hits.hits.<index>.fields.<fieldname>`. For example, to get the message field from the first hit, use `ctx.payload.hits.hits.0.fields.message`.

::::{note} 
The total number of hits in the search response is returned as an object in the response. It contains a `value`, the number of hits, and a `relation` that indicates if the value is accurate (`"eq"`) or a lower bound of the total hits that match the query (`"gte"`). You can set `track_total_hits` to true in the search request to tell Elasticsearch to always track the number of hits accurately.

| `request.search_type` | no | `query_then_fetch` | The [type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html#search-type) of search request to perform.

| `extract` | no | - | A array of JSON keys to extract from the search response and load as the payload.                                                                                    When a search generates a large response, you can use `extract` to select the                                                                                    relevant fields instead of loading the entire response. |

This setting                                                                                    overrides the default search operations timeouts. |
