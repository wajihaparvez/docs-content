# Cases [cases]

Cases are used to open and track issues directly in {{kib}}. You can add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations. You can create cases automatically when alerts occur or send cases to external incident management systems by configuring connectors.

You can also optionally add custom fields and case templates. [preview]

::::{note}
If you create cases in the {{observability}} or {{security-app}}, they are not visible in **{{stack-manage-app}}**. Likewise, the cases you create in **{{stack-manage-app}}** are not visible in the {{observability}} or {{security-app}}. You also cannot attach alerts from the {{observability}} or {{security-app}} to cases in **{{stack-manage-app}}**.
