::::{note}
Most of {{es}} [data types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html) are available in Elasticsearch SQL, as indicated above. As one can see, all of {{es}} [data types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html) are mapped to the data type with the same name in Elasticsearch SQL, with the exception of **date** data type which is mapped to **datetime** in Elasticsearch SQL. This is to avoid confusion with the ANSI SQL types **DATE** (date only) and **TIME** (time only), which are also supported by Elasticsearch SQL in queries (with the use of [`CAST`](sql-functions-type-conversion.md#sql-functions-type-conversion-cast)/[`CONVERT`](sql-functions-type-conversion.md#sql-functions-type-conversion-convert)), but don’t correspond to an actual mapping in {{es}} (see the [`table`](#es-sql-only-types) below).
::::


Obviously, not all types in {{es}} have an equivalent in SQL and vice-versa hence why, Elasticsearch SQL uses the data type *particularities* of the former over the latter as ultimately {{es}} is the backing store.

In addition to the types above, Elasticsearch SQL also supports at *runtime* SQL-specific types that do not have an equivalent in {{es}}. Such types cannot be loaded from {{es}} (as it does not know about them) however can be used inside Elasticsearch SQL in queries or their results.

## SQL and multi-fields [sql-multi-field]

A core concept in {{es}} is that of an `analyzed` field, that is a full-text value that is interpreted in order to be effectively indexed. These fields are of type [`text`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html) and are not used for sorting or aggregations as their actual value depends on the [`analyzer`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analyzer.html) used hence why {{es}} also offers the [`keyword`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/keyword.html) type for storing the *exact* value.

In most case, and the default actually, is to use both types for strings which {{es}} supports through [multi-fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html), that is the ability to index the same string in multiple ways; for example index it both as `text` for search but also as `keyword` for sorting and aggregations.

As SQL requires exact values, when encountering a `text` field Elasticsearch SQL will search for an exact multi-field that it can use for comparisons, sorting and aggregations. To do that, it will search for the first `keyword` that it can find that is *not* normalized and use that as the original field *exact* value.

Consider the following `string` mapping:

```js
{
  "first_name": {
    "type": "text",
    "fields": {
      "raw": {
        "type": "keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM index WHERE first_name = 'John'
```

is identical to:

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM index WHERE first_name.raw = 'John'
```

as Elasticsearch SQL automatically *picks* up the `raw` multi-field from `raw` for exact matching.
