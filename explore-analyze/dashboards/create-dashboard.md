# Create a dashboard [create-dashboard]

1. Open the **Dashboards** page in {{kib}}.
2. Select **Create dashboard** to start with an empty dashboard.

    When you create a dashboard, you are automatically in edit mode and can make changes to the dashboard.

3. Add content to the dashboard. You have several options covered in more detail in the [Visualizations section](../visualize.md#panels-editors):

    * [**Create visualization**](../visualize/lens.md). This option is a shortcut to create a chart using **Lens**, the default visualization editor in {{kib}}.
    * [**Add panel**](../visualize.md#panels-editors). Choose one of the available panels to add and configure content to your dashboard.
    * **Add from library**. Select existing content that has already been configured and saved to the **Visualize Library**.
    * [**Controls**](add-controls.md). Add controls to help filter the content of your dashboard.

4. Organize your dashboard by [organizing the various panels](arrange-panels.md).
5. Define the main settings of your dashboard from the **Settings** menu located in the toolbar.

    1. A meaningful title, description, and [tags](../find-and-organize/tags.md) allow you to find the dashboard quickly later when browsing your list of dashboards or using the {{kib}} search bar.
    2. Additional display options allow you unify the look and feel of the dashboard’s panels:

        * **Store time with dashboard** — Saves the specified time filter.
        * **Use margins between panels** — Adds a margin of space between each panel.
        * **Show panel titles** — Displays the titles in the panel headers.
        * **Sync color palettes across panels** — Applies the same color palette to all panels on the dashboard.
        * **Sync cursor across panels** — When you hover your cursor over a time series chart or a heatmap, the cursor on all other related dashboard charts automatically appears.
        * **Sync tooltips across panels** — When you hover your cursor over a **Lens** chart, the tooltips on all other related dashboard charts automatically appear.

    3. Click **Apply**.
