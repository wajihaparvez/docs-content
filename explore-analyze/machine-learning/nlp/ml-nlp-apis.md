# API quick reference [ml-nlp-apis]

All the trained models endpoints have the following base:

```js
/_ml/trained_models/
```

* [Create trained model aliases](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-trained-models-aliases.html)
* [Create trained model definition part](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-trained-model-definition-part.html)
* [Create trained models](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-trained-models.html)
* [Delete trained models](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/delete-trained-models.html)

You can also integrate NLP models from different providers such as Cohere, HuggingFace, or OpenAI and use them as a service through the {{infer}} API.

The {{infer}} APIs have the following base:

```js
/_inference/
```

* [Create inference endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-inference-api.html)
* [Delete inference endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/delete-inference-api.html)
* [Get inference endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/get-inference-api.html)
* [Perform inference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/post-inference-api.html)
